🔍 Business Insights:
📍 Location (Latitude & Longitude) and 🏗️ Structure Type are top predictors of wildfire damage.

🏚️ Older Buildings (lower Year Built) are significantly more vulnerable to fire risk.

💰 High-Value Properties (based on Assessed Improved Value) often include luxury homes, commercial buildings, or upgraded structures—requiring targeted protection strategies.


💼 Business Recommendations:
🚒 Fire Departments: Pre-position firefighting crews and equipment in predicted high-damage zones for rapid response.

🏘️ Cities & Municipalities: Enforce stricter building codes in high-risk areas, such as fire-resistant materials and defensible space regulations.

🏡 Realtors & Real Estate Platforms: Incorporate Wildfire Risk Scores into property listings, helping buyers make informed decisions.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Homebuyers: Avoid hidden-risk properties, reducing long-term financial and safety losses.

⚡ Electric Utilities: Use predictive analytics to preemptively de-energize power lines in high-risk zones—proven to cut ignition risk by 40%+ (per PG&E case study).
